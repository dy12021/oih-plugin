# p2rank — ML binding pocket prediction

Runs P2Rank `prank predict` in the `oih-p2rank` container. Input structure comes
from `$OIH_HOME/data/inputs`, output lands in `$OIH_HOME/data/outputs/<job_name>_p2rank/`.

## Command

```bash
bash "${PLUGIN_DIR}/skills/oih-p2rank/scripts/oih-p2rank.sh" "$pdb_path" "$job_name"
```

`$pdb_path` may be an absolute host path or just a filename under inputs/.
The script prints `OIH_STATUS: OK` on success plus the top pocket lines.

Note: the very first run downloads/loads the Java ML model and can take ~6
minutes; subsequent runs are fast (seconds). Do not interrupt the first run.

## Reading the result

Output directory: `$OIH_HOME/data/outputs/<job_name>_p2rank/`
- `<stem>.pdb_predictions.csv` — one row per predicted pocket, ranked by
  probability/score (column names are `probability` / `prediction` /
  `rank` depending on p2rank version)
- `<stem>.pdb_residues.csv` — per-residue pocket membership for each prediction

Report to the user: the top 3 pockets with their rank and score
(probability), and which residues define pocket 1. Cross-check with fpocket
(oih-fpocket skill) when druggability/volume numbers are also needed.

## Notes

- Pocket centers (pocket centroid columns in the CSV) can feed docking box
  centers for gnina (oih-gnina) or vina-gpu (oih-vina-gpu).
- Input must be PDB format (not mmCIF) for this container build.
